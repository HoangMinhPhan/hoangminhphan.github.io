  title={Building blocks for a digital twin of large cool store complexes.},

  abstract={Digital twins are virtual representations that serve as real-time digital counterparts of physical objects 
spanning their full lifecycle. In the context of postharvest horticulture, these represent infrastructure (storage 
plants including refrigeration and controlled atmosphere systems) and the produce being handled (fruit and 
vegetables). The aim of the digital twin is to be used in real-time to support decision-making throughout the 
logistic handling chain, considering targets for, among others, product quality, food losses, energy use, 
emissions, and costs. Working with biological produce involves accounting for the inevitable biological 
variance, but also uncertainty exists in terms of unforeseen temporal and spatial variations within cold 
rooms. This contribution will present a review of the state of the art of models that can be used for the digital 
twin for large cool store complexes, including fully resolved as well as reduced order models of heat and mass 
transfer, as well as kinetics models while addressing issues with uncertainty propagation at both the 
theoretical and applied levels. Challenges and solutions for sensor-digital twin integration are discussed.},

abstract = {A particular challenge for food quality inspection remains the quantification of internal defects. This work addresses the challenge of internal defects segmentation in pear fruit (cv. Conference) based on high-throughput inline X-ray radiography images in combination with deep learning. Unlike previous approaches, which focused on healthy vs defect classification, the current segmentation approach is able to determine the type of defect, its dimensions, and location. To this end, a novel simulation method was designed to obtain input-target image pairs of radiography data, and more diverse defect pears were generated using a conditioned generator model. The obtained data contributed to the design of a segmentation model that labeled every pixel in the X-ray radiographs of pear fruit as ‘external air’, ‘healthy tissue’, ‘core’, ‘browning’, or ‘cavity’. We demonstrated that additional synthetic data in the learning process drastically improved the model performance. For instance, the mean IoU increased from 0.781 ± 0.112 to 0.883 ± 0.088 for consumable pears with minor cavities and browning. In terms of utility, our segmentation maps provide more detailed information about the type, size, and location of the disorders compared to the heatmaps produced by existing benchmark classifiers.}
