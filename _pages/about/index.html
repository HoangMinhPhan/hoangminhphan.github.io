By creating a virtual replica of the physical system, the digital twin offers practical applications to enhance the controllability and predictability of fruit quality and system operation. This research project enables me to explore multidisciplinary engineering fields, including physics-based modeling, process engineering, system optimization, transport phenomena, uncertainty quantification, and data science, and then apply these concepts to the postharvest domain. With this project, I can develop specialist expertise from theoretical concepts to large-scale implementation in the food industry.</p> <p>My solid engineering background was built from a joint master’s program in Food Technology at both KU Leuven and UGent. Throughout this program, I developed skill sets in physics-based and data-driven modeling to solve problems in the food industry. Notably, I successfully applied Deep Learning (AI) and X-ray imaging to develop a non-destructive sorting technology for pears with internal browning disorder in my master’s thesis. Additionally, I acquired advanced analytical techniques, such as GC, HPLC, DSC, NIR spectroscopy, and Instrument Texture Analysis.</p> <p>Apart from academic experience, I am also a passionate process engineer with experience in the food industry, specializing in processing systems, piping, and plant layout design, as well as capital expenditure (CapEx) project management (PM).</p> </body></html>
